# Ryan, as your manager
__I want you to succeed and grow on this team. I will support you and advocate for you to the rest of the company.__

## Expectations of You
* __You are a responsible individual.__ You are a talented and professional adult who can make informed decisions and follow through with actions. For more, see DRI - [DRI Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-well-does-Apples-Directly-Responsible-Individual-DRI-model-work-in-practice) and [DRI Medium](https://medium.com/@mmamet/directly-responsible-individuals-f5009f465da4)

* __Safe debate__ - You should be comfortable debating with me and other team members. Other team members should feel comfortable debating with you. Utilize discussions as a way to explore different angles of problems and improve as an individual and as a team.

* __Know why__ - You strive for high level understanding of our direction overall. Seek clarification and raise concerns early regarding goals of projects and reasoning behind different approaches.

* __Invest in you__ - Please take time in your natural workflow to develop yourself professionally. Learn and share new tech, best practices, papers, etc with your team. I value this activity and will support you in this pursuit.

* __Give feedback__ - I will not treat feedback you give me as “complaining”. I take each feedback seriously, and I plan to use feedback as a way to help you and improve the team. If you can offer a solution to a problem, that's a plus, but that is not required. You can give feedback on just about anything, including but not limited to interactions with me and colleagues, specific annoyances and inefficiencies, general things which seem bad or “off”, etc. Although I have painted feedback as negative here, you are encouraged to give positive feedback and let me know what _is_ working as well. I believe feedback should roughly adhere to these qualities:
  * _Safe_ - You feel safe to give and get candid feedback.
  * _Easy_ - The distraction/energy/effort to give or get feedback should be low.
  * _Benefit_ - There should be an impact that comes from the feedback you give.

## Expectations of Me
* __Happy and Effective__ - I am concerned about your happiness _and_ your effectiveness. I want you to be successful and that, to a degree, means you are effective in your role.

* __Helpful Resource__ - I want to be someone you come to for help when you are stuck. I will share experience, escalate issues to other people, and/or work with you to resolve blockers.

* __Give context__ - I should be providing you context about your projects, what other teams are doing, and what we are accomplishing as a team. I should be helping you to understand the "why". Why do this project? How does this help the business? Why this timeline for delivery?

* __I adjust to you__ - While friction can exist in a team of diverse personalities, I believe the more senior members should do most of the adjusting. I will work with each of you to understand your styles, and I will adjust to make each individual member as effective as possible in this team.

* __1:1__ - A meeting to discuss life, the universe, and everything. Career goals, new ideas, and other questions are all on the table. I prefer this not be a status update. You can request a cadence you find most useful but I may request a compromise. Don’t hesitate to reschedule.

## Meetings + Updates
* If you are pulled into too many meetings that you think are unproductive for you, let me know, and we can find compromise.

* If you want to talk, check my calendar or message me. If there is no room on my calendar, first check that I am alive. Then, let me know and I will evict something less important so I can meet with you.

* When sharing updates, I like larger milestones over incomplete pieces. This does not apply to sharing context when you are blocked, need input, etc.

## Your time is _your_ time

* I prefer longer periods of uninterrupted work. Feel free to set your status to away and/or not check chat/email when you need to focus. For more on this topic, see [Deep Work](http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/). I have a copy.

* If I message you outside work hours, don't feel obligated to respond in general. If something needs an urgent response, I will figure out how to reach you; otherwise, it’s not urgent.


__WORK IN PROGRESS__
