# Ryan, as your manager
I want you to succeed and grow on this team. I will support you and advocate for you to the rest of the company.

# Expectations of You
* You are a responsible individual. I will treat you as a talented and professional adult who can make informed decisions and follow through with actions. For more, see DRI - DRI Quora and DRI Medium

* Safe debate - You should be comfortable debating me and other team members. Other team members should feel comfortable debating you. Utilize discussions as a way to explore different angles of problems and improve as an individual and as a team.

* Know why - Strive for high level understanding of our direction overall. Seek clarification and raise concerns early regarding goals of projects and reasoning behind different approaches.

* Invest in you - Please take time in your natural workflow to develop yourself professionally. Share new tech, best practices, and papers with your team. I value this activity and will support you in this pursuit.

* Give feedback - This may include but not limited to:  interactions with me and colleagues, specific annoyances and inefficiencies, general things which seem bad or “off”, etc. I will not treat feedback you give me as “complaining”; I will see it as a way we could improve as a team.
